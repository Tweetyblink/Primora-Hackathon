  # Primora – Guided Program Design for NGOs

Primora is a guided, gamified program design and reflection tool that helps education NGOs structure their program logic with clarity, alignment, and iteration.

---

## Problem
Education NGOs often know *what* problem they want to address, but struggle to design clear programs that link:
- student outcomes
- system actors
- interventions
- and measurement

Existing frameworks like the Common Logical Framework (LFA) are valuable but difficult to apply without expert support.

---

## Solution
Primora breaks program design into **guided, step-by-step checkpoints** that help organisations:
- identify student, teacher, or system-level causes
- reflect on baseline understanding
- plan interventions
- define how impact will be measured
- iterate when designs don’t work as expected

The tool focuses on **design readiness**, not execution.

---

## What This Prototype Demonstrates
- Guided selection of education outcomes (FLN & Career Readiness)
- Root-cause identification (Student / Teacher / System)
- Design checkpoints (Survey, Workshop, Measurement)
- Iterative design flow (“Did Not Work” → refine)
- Generation of a concise, review-ready program design summary

---

## What This Prototype Does NOT Do
- Run real surveys or assessments  
- Process or validate student data  
- Execute on-ground NGO activities  

These activities are intentionally kept offline, as they are NGO-led in real-world settings.

## Tech Overview
- **Frontend:** Figma-based interactive prototype  
- **Logic Layer:** Rule-based evaluation (TypeScript)  
- **Backend:** Client-side logic (no server for prototype)
